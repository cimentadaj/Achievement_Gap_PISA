# An analysis of the achievement gap between top-bottom SES students over time.

In this repository I keep the files for the second chapter of my PhD thesis.

This is still very much a work in process, so it is very disorganized. All PISA waves I use are taken from [Przemyslaw Biecek](https://github.com/pbiecek?tab=repositories) and his `PISA*lite` packages, except for PISA 2012 and PISA 2015, which I also keep in this repository. After I complete the analysis I will update everything to be reproducible into a single comprehensive file. For now, this will be a very informal analysis.
